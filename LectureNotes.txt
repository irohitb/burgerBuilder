Note: In Index.css we setup global body style since rendor starts from Index.js and we import it in Index.js
//To change font-family from imported fonts from google -> Public -> Index.html
//We will use component to manage state and container for everything else
//<main> Tag is used to showcase main content
//IF we have two adjacent jsx element (we can't have), We have to use array and give each item a key
//Another alternate is create HOC -> It will server purpose of wrapping something and passing function

//Question to ask, Why didn't we used div?

//Lecture 5
//Css -> Npm run eject -> webpack -> Options
//Removed logo
//Removed most of the content from App.js
//Index.css change font
//removed App.css


//lecture 6
//We can seperate our project into two parts
//Toolbar to navigate and the main burger builder
//We create a sub folder for layout
//We created Component and container -> we will create container in components because we don't need to manage any state
//In components -> Sub folder -> Layout -> in layout , layout.js file
//We create assests folder
//In layout.js, we use *main and there we will put component we will wrap with this content -> hence we will use props.children
//*We use this component as a wrapper around the core content component we want to render to the screen
//Now in main.js,we want have two adjacent element but since we cannot have two adjacet JSX element together, we create HOC named Aux
//Aux is simple -> Takes props and return props
//We import Aux to our Layout and layout to app
//Run the app afterwards


//Lecture 7
//Starting the implementation of the burger builder
//---x-x----x--x---
//This should actually be a container because here we need to manage the state of burger
//We created a new folder in container known as burger Builder
//Burger Builder contains Burger and Burger Controls
//We wrap it with Aux like we wrapped layout
//We imported it to App.js
//We wrapped it inside layout.s
