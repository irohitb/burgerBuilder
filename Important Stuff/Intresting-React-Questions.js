Hi Rohit,   Regarding props,   they can be a non-dynamic string (btnType="Danger"),  or,
a dynamic variable can be used (myNameProps={this.state.name}).
Occasionally,  the non-dynamic string version can be very useful.    MLR
EXTRA  INFORMATION:
You'll see the same thing with classname="myCssClass" & classname={myCombinedClassesUsingJoin}*/
